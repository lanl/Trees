real function normal(mu,sigma)
!-----------------------------------------------------------------
! normal is a function which randomly samples a number from a 
! gaussian distribution using the Box-Muller Transform with mu 
! being the mean and sigma the standard deviation
!-----------------------------------------------------------------
use constant_variables

implicit none

! Local Variables
real x1,x2,mu,sigma

! Executable Code
call random_number(x1)
call random_number(x2)
normal = sigma*sqrt(-2.0*log(x1))*cos(2*PI*x2)+mu
 
end function normal
