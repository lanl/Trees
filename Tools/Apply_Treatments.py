#   This script does post-processing treatments for trees program output.
#   Input:  .dat output from trees, number of fuel types
#   Output: .dat trees, adjusted/treated values of density, moisture, and/or depth 
#   CURRENTLY THIS SCRIPT WILL REMOVE ALL CANOPY FUELS FROM THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE DOMAIN

#STEP 1======================
#open fuel files and store in numpy array from processing
#These are 4D arrays: 1st position is species ID, 2nd is x, 3rd is y, 4th is z
rhof  = readFile(pf, datfile1, nfuel, Nx, Ny, Nz) #FUEL DENSITY ARRAY
moist = readFile(pf, datfile2, nfuel, Nx, Ny, Nz) #FUEL MOISTURE ARRAY
fd    = readFile(pf, datfile3, nfuel, Nx, Ny, Nz) #FUEL DEPTH ARRAY
ss    = readFile(pf, datfile4, nfuel, Nx, Ny, Nz) #FUEL SIZE SCALE ARRAY

#STEP 2=======================
#Here is where you can adjust fuels and create/apply treatments
#The structure of the fuel arrays is [nfuel, Nx, Ny, Nz]
#Note when manipulating arrays, put locations in terms of CELLS, NOT METERS
#The example below assumes we have 1 grass fuel type and nfuel-1 canopy fuel types
#We will remove canopy fuels from the left hand side of the domain:

        moist[i,:25,:,:] = 0.0
        fd[i,:25,:,:] = 0.0

#STEP 3=======================
#Write the output files to your specificed location
