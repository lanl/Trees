real function paraboloid(a,x,x0,y,y0,z0)
!----------------------------------------------------------------
! paraboloid is a function which defines a 3D quadric surface
! a is the sole parameter defined for the function
! x0,y0,z0 are are the point of inflection
! x,y are the tested cartesian coordinates
!----------------------------------------------------------------
implicit none

! Local Variables
real a
real x,y
real x0,y0,z0

! Executable Code
paraboloid = z0+((x-x0)**2.+(y-y0)**2.)/a

end function paraboloid
