!The species .csv file for this trees program needs to include the following lists of variables:

!leafmassavg, leafareaavg, leafdrop, decay, droptime

!leafmassavg = average mass of a single leaf on the tree in grams (will be translated to kg)
!        ADD INFO FOR EACH SPECIES FOR REFERENCE
!leafareaavg = average surface area of a single leaf on the tree in cm^2 (will be translated into m^2)
!        ADD INFO FOR EACH SPECIES FOR REFERENCE
!leafdrop = number of years a leaf will remain on the tree in years
!        ADD INFO FOR EACH SPECIES FOR REFERENCE
!decayconstant = decay constant for the average leaf; dimensions: 1/year 
!droptime = when during the year do the leaves fall? StepsPerYear is in the surfgridlist
!        For instance, if we have type 1 drops its leaves in October and type 2 drops its leaves in May, we could do one of the following:
!              Set StepsPerYear = 2, set type1 droptime = 1 and type2 droptime = 2,
!                   Or
!              Set StepsPerYear = 4, set type1 droptime = 1 and type2 droptime = 3,
!                   Or
!              Set StepsPerYear = 12, set type1 droptime = 2 and type2 droptime = 9.
!if run includes multiple tfuelbins then set each bin separately (ie loop through each tfuelbin first then through each species second)
