real function zcart(aa1,sigma,nz,dz,zsij)
!-----------------------------------------------------------------
! zcart is a function which computes the cartesian vertical 
! coordianate
! sigma is sigma coordinate
! aa1 is the logrithmic stretching coefficient
! zs is the vertical height of the ground
!-----------------------------------------------------------------
implicit none

! Local Variables
integer nz
real zb,dz,zsij,f
real aa1,aa2,aa3    
real sigma,gdeform

! Executable Code
zb = nz*dz
f  = 0.0
aa2= f*(1-aa1)/zb
aa3= (1-aa2*zb-aa1)/zb**2.0

gdeform = aa3*sigma**3.0+aa2*sigma**2.0+aa1*sigma 
zcart   = gdeform*(zb-zsij)/zb+zsij

end function zcart
